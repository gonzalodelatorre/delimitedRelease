xH 0 -> High

If yl is 1, then i can discover that xH is true. So it won´t compile.

If i uncomment this line, the program will get an error:

No instance for (LEq 'High 'Low) arising from a use of ‘iff’

This is correct because it prevents information flow from lower variables 
to higher variables.
