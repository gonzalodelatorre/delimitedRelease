HList is a data type defined to represent the environment as list of types. All of his elements have kind (Nat, SType).
See below an example on how to use this data type.

nine :: SNat Nine
nine = SSucc eight

We can build our own environment using HList data type, using the numbers defined previously.
This way we can build a value-level list, that contains a heterogeneous list of types as a type. 
Below one can find one example.


securityEnvironment = (zero, L) :-: (one, H) :-: (two, H) :-: (three, H) :-: (four, H) :-: Nil
